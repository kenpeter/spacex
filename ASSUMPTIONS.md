# Changes to the starter project
* `GET /lauchPadFullNames` to get launch pad full names.
* `GET /launchYears` to get all launch years.
* `GET /launchAndPad`, this merges `launches.json` and `launchpads.json`. It allows easy to filter and consume. Front end passes params and get the results nicely.
