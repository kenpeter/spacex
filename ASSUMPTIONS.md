# Assumptions
* None

# Still to do
* None

# Changes to the starter project
* Previously, we need to `cd to server`, then run `npm start`, then `cd to react-project`, then run `npm start`. Now we are able to do everything in 1 go. `cd to react-project`, then `npm start`.
* `GET /lauchPadFullNames` to get launch pad full names.
* `GET /launchYears` to get all launch years.
* `GET /launchAndPad`, this merges `launches.json` and `launchpads.json`. It allows easy to filter and consume. Front end passes params and get the results nicely.
