# Assumptions
* None

# Still to do
* None

# Changes to the starter project
* The server is run by `npm start`. I replaced `node` with `nodemon`, which allows easy changing.
* `GET /lauchPadFullNames` to get launch pad full names.
* `GET /launchYears` to get all launch years.
* `GET /launchAndPad`, this merges `launches.json` and `launchpads.json`. It allows easy to filter and consume. Front end passes params and get the results nicely.
