    "details": "NASA historic launch pad that launched most of the Saturn V and Space Shuttle missions. Initially for Falcon Heavy launches, it is now launching all of SpaceX east coast missions due to the damage from the AMOS-6 anomaly. After SLC-40 repairs are complete, it will be upgraded to support Falcon Heavy, a process which will take about two months. In the future it will launch commercial crew missions and the Interplanetary Transport System."
